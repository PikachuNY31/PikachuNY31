Sometimes you will have elements that have multiple axes by which they can be sorted. For example: `const arr = [{name: 'Leo', age: 27}, {name: Travis, age: 24}]`. You could sort this object by name but also by  age.

A **stable sort** keeps the original order but creates a sub-order that stores the sorted order. An **unstable sort** updates the original order.

## Stable Sort
- merge sort
- bubble sort
- insertion sort

## Unstable sort
- selection sort
- heap sort
- quick sort
